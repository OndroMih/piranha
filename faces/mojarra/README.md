# Piranha Faces - Mojarra Integration

The Piranha Faces - Mojarra Integration module delivers you with Eclipse
Mojarra integration.

Add the following dependency to your project to use it.

      <dependency>
          <groupId>cloud.piranha.faces</groupId>
          <artifactId>piranha-faces-mojarra</artifactId>
          <version>x.y.z</version>
      </dependency>

Make sure you use the same version of Piranha itself.

Note that this example does not set the &lt;scope&gt; but depending on what you
are using Piranha for you might need to add a &lt;scope&gt;.
